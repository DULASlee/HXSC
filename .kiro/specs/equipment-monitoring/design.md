# Design Document: Equipment Monitoring System

## Overview

The Equipment Monitoring feature extends the SmartConstruction platform to provide comprehensive real-time monitoring, analytics, and management capabilities for construction equipment. This design document outlines the architecture, components, data models, and integration points necessary to implement the requirements specified in the requirements document.

The system will leverage existing SmartConstruction infrastructure while adding new components specific to equipment monitoring, including telemetry data collection, real-time processing, geolocation tracking, predictive maintenance algorithms, and mobile access capabilities.

## Architecture

The Equipment Monitoring system will follow a microservices-oriented architecture that integrates with the existing SmartConstruction system. The architecture consists of the following key components:

### Core Components

1. **Data Ingestion Service**
   - Receives telemetry data from equipment IoT sensors
   - Validates and normalizes incoming data
   - Routes data to appropriate processing services
   - Handles high-volume data streams with minimal latency

2. **Real-time Processing Service**
   - Processes incoming telemetry data in real-time
   - Detects status changes and anomalies
   - Triggers alerts based on predefined conditions
   - Updates equipment status in the database
   - Implements SignalR for real-time updates to clients

3. **Alert Service**
   - Evaluates equipment data against predefined rules
   - Generates maintenance alerts based on predictive algorithms
   - Manages alert lifecycle (creation, notification, acknowledgment, resolution)
   - Prioritizes alerts based on severity and impact

4. **Analytics Service**
   - Processes historical equipment data
   - Generates utilization reports and performance metrics
   - Provides optimization recommendations
   - Supports data export in various formats

5. **Notification Service**
   - Delivers alerts through multiple channels (dashboard, email, SMS)
   - Manages notification preferences and subscriptions
   - Handles delivery confirmation and escalation

6. **Geolocation Service**
   - Tracks equipment location in real-time
   - Manages geofencing and zone-based alerts
   - Provides historical movement data
   - Detects proximity between equipment

7. **API Gateway**
   - Provides unified API access to all equipment monitoring features
   - Handles authentication and authorization
   - Implements rate limiting and request validation
   - Supports both web and mobile clients

8. **Web UI - Dashboard**
   - Displays real-time equipment status and alerts
   - Provides interactive maps for equipment location
   - Offers analytics visualizations and reports
   - Supports equipment management functions

9. **Mobile Application**
   - Provides field access to equipment data
   - Supports QR code scanning for equipment identification
   - Implements offline mode for limited connectivity scenarios
   - Delivers proximity-based notifications

## Components and Interfaces

### Data Collection and Ingestion

#### Equipment IoT Integration

The system will support multiple protocols for equipment data collection:
- MQTT for lightweight IoT communication
- HTTP/REST for equipment with direct internet connectivity
- Gateway-based collection for equipment with proprietary protocols

Each equipment type will have a corresponding adapter that normalizes data into a standard format before ingestion.

`

### Real-time Monitoring

#### Dashboard Components

The real-time monitoring dashboard will include:
- Equipment status overview with filtering capabilities
- Detailed equipment view with operational parameters
- Interactive site map showing equipment locations
- Alert panel with prioritized notifications
- Performance metrics with real-time updates

#### SignalR Integration

Real-time updates will be implemented using SignalR:
- Equipment status changes will be pushed to connected clients
- Clients will subscribe to specific equipment or categories
- Connection loss detection with automatic reconnection
- Fallback to polling when WebSockets are not available

### Analytics and Reporting

    E --> G[Export Service]
`

#### Report Types

The system will support the following report types:
- Equipment utilization by time period
- Performance comparison across equipment types
- Maintenance history and impact analysis
- Cost analysis and optimization opportunities
- Safety compliance and incident reports

### Predictive Maintenance

#### Algorithm Approach

The predictive maintenance system will use a multi-model approach:
- Rule-based detection for known failure patterns
- Statistical analysis for deviation from normal operation
- Machine learning models for complex pattern recognition
- Hybrid models combining multiple approaches

#### Maintenance Workflow
