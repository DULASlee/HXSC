# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Equipment Monitoring feature aims to enhance the SmartConstruction system by providing real-time monitoring, alerts, and analytics for construction equipment on site. This feature will help construction managers track equipment usage, detect anomalies, prevent failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve overall equipment efficiency and safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Equipment Monitoring

**User Story:** As a site manager, I want to monitor equipment status in real-time, so that I can ensure optimal operation and quickly respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the equipment monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display the current status of all equipment on site.
2. WHEN equipment sends telemetry data THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard within 5 seconds.
3. WHEN equipment status changes (active, idle, off, maintenance) THEN the system SHALL reflect this change on the dashboard immediately.
4. WHEN a user selects a specific piece of equipment THEN the system SHALL display detailed information including location, operational parameters, and historical data.
5. WHEN telemetry data cannot be received from equipment THEN the system SHALL mark the equipment as "connection lost" after 60 seconds.
### Requirement 2: Equipment Performance Analytics

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to analyze equipment performance metrics, so that I can optimize resource allocation and improve efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the analytics section THEN the system SHALL provide usage statistics for all equipment.
2. WHEN a user selects a date range THEN the system SHALL display equipment utilization rates within that period.
3. WHEN a user selects specific equipment THEN the system SHALL show performance trends over time.
4. WHEN equipment performance falls below defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL highlight this in reports.
5. WHEN a user exports analytics data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV and PDF format options.

### Requirement 3: Predictive Maintenance Alerts

**User Story:** As a maintenance supervisor, I want to receive predictive maintenance alerts, so that I can prevent equipment failures and reduce downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN equipment operational parameters indicate potential issues THEN the system SHALL generate a maintenance alert.
2. WHEN a maintenance alert is generated THEN the system SHALL notify designated personnel via the dashboard, email, and SMS.
3. WHEN an alert is generated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the potential issue and recommended actions.
4. WHEN a user acknowledges an alert THEN the system SHALL record the acknowledgment with timestamp and user information.
5. WHEN maintenance is performed THEN the system SHALL allow recording of maintenance activities and reset relevant alert counters.

### Requirement 4: Equipment Geolocation Tracking

**User Story:** As a site supervisor, I want to track the location of equipment on site, so that I can optimize placement and prevent unauthorized use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN equipment with GPS capabilities is active THEN the system SHALL display its location on a site map.
2. WHEN equipment moves outside designated work zones THEN the system SHALL generate an alert.
3. WHEN a user selects equipment on the map THEN the system SHALL display its movement history.
4. WHEN equipment remains idle in one location for longer than a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL highlight this on the dashboard.
5. WHEN multiple pieces of equipment are in close proximity THEN the system SHALL provide a visual indication to help prevent collisions.

### Requirement 5: Equipment Utilization Optimization

**User Story:** As a resource manager, I want to optimize equipment utilization across projects, so that I can reduce costs and improve project timelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning a new project THEN the system SHALL recommend equipment allocation based on historical usage patterns.
2. WHEN equipment is underutilized THEN the system SHALL suggest reallocation to other projects.
3. WHEN equipment is scheduled for multiple projects THEN the system SHALL detect conflicts and alert managers.
4. WHEN new equipment is added to the system THEN the system SHALL integrate it into the optimization algorithms.
5. WHEN equipment utilization reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include cost analysis and savings opportunities.

### Requirement 6: Mobile Access to Equipment Data

**User Story:** As a field worker, I want to access equipment information on mobile devices, so that I can make informed decisions while on site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the system from a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for small screens.
2. WHEN a mobile user scans an equipment QR code THEN the system SHALL display relevant information for that specific equipment.
3. WHEN a mobile user is near equipment requiring attention THEN the system SHALL send proximity-based notifications.
4. WHEN network connectivity is limited THEN the system SHALL provide essential functionality in offline mode.
5. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize offline data with the central system.

### Requirement 7: Equipment Safety Compliance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a safety officer, I want to monitor equipment safety compliance, so that I can ensure workplace safety and regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN equipment safety parameters exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate safety alerts.
2. WHEN safety inspections are due THEN the system SHALL notify relevant personnel.
3. WHEN safety certifications are about to expire THEN the system SHALL generate renewal reminders.
4. WHEN safety incidents occur THEN the system SHALL provide tools to document the incident and track resolution.
5. WHEN safety reports are required THEN the system SHALL generate compliance documentation for regulatory purposes.
