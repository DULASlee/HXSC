# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to fix all compilation errors in the SmartConstruction project to ensure the project builds successfully. The project currently has multiple compilation errors that need to be addressed, including type conversion issues, missing methods, null reference handling, and component reference problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Service Layer Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all compilation errors in the Service layer so that the backend services function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are type conversion errors in DeviceService THEN the system SHALL fix the incorrect usage of long types that are trying to use HasValue and Value properties.
2. WHEN there are incorrect Expression type conversions in ProjectService THEN the system SHALL correct the Expression type to match the expected Expression<Func<T, bool>> type.
3. WHEN there are missing method errors in UnitOfWork THEN the system SHALL add the correct method calls or import the necessary namespaces.
4. WHEN there are incorrect parameter types in method calls THEN the system SHALL correct the parameter types to match the expected method signatures.
5. WHEN there are property access errors in entities THEN the system SHALL correct the property names or add the missing properties.

### Requirement 2: Fix Null Reference Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly handle null references in the codebase so that the application is more robust and complies with nullable reference type requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN null literals are assigned to non-nullable reference types THEN the system SHALL either make the types nullable or provide non-null default values.
2. WHEN constructors don't initialize non-nullable properties THEN the system SHALL ensure all non-nullable properties are properly initialized.
3. WHEN methods may return null for non-nullable return types THEN the system SHALL add null checks or make the return types nullable.
4. WHEN methods have async signatures but no await operators THEN the system SHALL either add await operators or remove the async keyword.

### Requirement 3: Fix Web Project Component References

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all component reference errors in the Web project so that the UI renders correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are unknown component references like 'MBtn', 'MImg', etc. THEN the system SHALL add the necessary @using directives for these components.
2. WHEN components are missing required parameters THEN the system SHALL provide the required parameter values.
3. WHEN there are redirect component errors THEN the system SHALL fix the references to these components.

### Requirement 4: Fix Package References and Warnings

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to address package reference warnings and other minor issues so that the project is free from warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are package version conflicts or security vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL update the packages to compatible and secure versions.
2. WHEN there are unused variables or unnecessary code THEN the system SHALL clean up the code to remove warnings.
